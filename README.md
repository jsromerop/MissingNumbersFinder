# MissingNumbersFinder

A Python utility to find missing numbers within a specified range from a given list.

This project provides a Python function to determine missing numbers in a list where elements are expected to be within a range of [0, n]. The function efficiently identifies missing elements using sets.

def find_missing_numbers_set(lst):
    # ... (Code for the function) 

# Example usage

my_list = [6, 8, 2, 3, 5, 7, 0, 1, 10]
missing_numbers = missing_numbers.find_missing_numbers_set(my_list)

if missing_numbers == -1:
    print("No missing numbers")
else:
    print("Missing numbers:", missing_numbers)  # Output: Missing numbers: [4, 9] 
```
